# 🌮 The Little Taco Shop Website

Welcome to the official repository for **The Little Taco Shop**, a simple HTML project that showcases a fictional taco restaurant's website. This project was created as part of my learning journey in HTML.

## 🧠 What I Learned
Through building this website, I gained hands-on experience with core HTML concepts and best practices:

### ✅ HTML Structure & Semantics
- Used proper document structure with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- Implemented semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` to improve readability and accessibility.

### ✅ Metadata & SEO
- Added metadata such as `author`, `description`, and `viewport` for better SEO and responsiveness.

### ✅ Navigation & Linking
- Created internal page anchors and external links using `<a>` tags.
- Practiced linking to other HTML pages and using meaningful navigation structure.

### ✅ Forms & Inputs
- Built a functional contact form using `<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<fieldset>`.
- Used form validation attributes like `required` and proper input types (`email`, `text`).

### ✅ Images & Media
- Embedded images with `alt`, `title`, and `figcaption` for context and accessibility.
- Used the `<figure>` element to semantically wrap image content.

### ✅ Tables
- Built a structured menu using `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>`, `rowspan`, and `colspan` for proper data representation.

### ✅ Accessibility & Extras
- Used `<abbr>`, `<time>`, and `<details>` tags to provide additional context and interactivity.
- Ensured text alternatives and accessible markup for better UX.
